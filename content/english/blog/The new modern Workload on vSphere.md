### vSphere 7 with Tanzu is transforming the way people are approaching modernizing their on-prem application delivery. With the native integration of Kubernetes within the platform, the doors have opened to deliver the new application stack within the vSphere environment. Gone are those days when you could only deploy VMs within the vSphere platform. With the integration of Tanzu, you can now natively deploy new objects like pods, load balancers, Kubernetes clusters alongside VMs. With the release of the much-awaited VM Operator feature (version 7.0u2a), the DevOps persona can even leverage standard Kubernetes processes and CLIs to deploy VMs along with pods. In this article, with an easy-to-follow example, I will discuss how the DevOps persona can leverage their Kubernetes tool of choice to deploy an application stack consisting of Kubernetes clusters, VMs, pods, registries, and load balancers.
