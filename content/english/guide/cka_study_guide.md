### Exam taking tips

Be very comfortable with vi editor of linux.
Practise imperative commands and depending on yaml will lead to mistakes and time consumption
Practise all the tasks from the kubernetes.io and book mark the pages corresponding to the syllabus.
Make sure to login to the master nodes for upgrade and debugging question
use sudo , don't login as root because thats an additional exit
when restoring etcd snapshot make sure you restore to the provided backup and also update the etcd.yaml and wait for the etcd pod to start.
make sure not to spend more than 5 mins on a 4% question.
Only use imperative command for all operations. know your commands and careful with the version of documentation you are referring. its v1.19.0
DO NOT ATTEMPT ANY QUESTION WITHOUT READING AND DO NOT START WITHOUT CHANGING CONTEXT. 
IF U LOGIN TO NODE DON'T FORGET TO EXIT. All commands in the nodes have to use "SUDO".
START ANSWERING ONLY AFTER AUTOCOMPLETE IS CREATED. <the kubernetes cheat sheet first line.>


### Pro Tips 
The exam comes with a free re-take, incase you feel that you are not able to reach the passing score of 66% , concentrate on remembering the questions.

You are most likely to get the same questions in the second attempt.

This applies only when you are fully prepared and not able to answer due to time crunch or exam nervousness (smile) . Not in any other scenario that i know of
