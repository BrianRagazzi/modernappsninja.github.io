### Call Cancelled on 6/18/21 in Observance of Juneteenth

To borrow from VMware’s internal announcement – “Juneteenth ― a blend of the words June and nineteenth ― is an important day for America as it commemorates the end of slavery on June 19, 1865, which is two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. Recognizing Juneteenth isn’t only about that one day in 1865, but rather, it honors a process of racial equality that is still ongoing.”  

I am glad to see that in the U.S. VMware is now recognizing Juneteenth as an official holiday in respect of the tremendous significance for which it stands, and likewise the ModernApps Learning Office Hours and SRE Live! calls will be cancelled in observance.  

From Juneteenth.com:  
  
“Today Juneteenth commemorates African American freedom and emphasizes education and achievement. It is a day, a week, and in some areas a month marked with celebrations, guest speakers, picnics and family gatherings. It is a time for reflection and rejoicing. It is a time for assessment, self-improvement and for planning the future. Its growing popularity signifies a level of maturity and dignity in America long over due. In cities across the country, people of all races, nationalities and religions are joining hands to truthfully acknowledge a period in our history that shaped and continues to influence our society today. Sensitized to the conditions and experiences of others, only then can we make significant and lasting improvements in our society.”




### About Event

There is a huge gap between classroom learning and the complexities of real-world environments, and during times of significant change this gap is formidable.
 
ModernApps Learning has its own vision, goals and infrastructure and we the community design, develop and deliver all aspects of the platform.  We are a project hosted by VMware and develop and manage production assets. We are much like many programs within large organizations, with one key difference - we are designed to be managed with and by our open community, facilitated by VMware.  
 
On the SRE Live! call we will be doing live planning, design, and implementation of all aspects of the ModernApps Learning Platform. We will be using agile planning and implement devops/gitops processes, CICD workflows, and strive step-by-step towards cloud native best practice implementations, together as a community.  
 
Hope to see you on the call!
