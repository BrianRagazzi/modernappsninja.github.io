### About Event

This past week we held the first ever ModernApps SRE Live! Call, and will continue to hold this call every Friday Morning. 

On the initial SRE Live! Call, we went through an overview of our content and platform strategy, and then started reviewing our process & project management tools with GitHub Projects and reviewed some of the types of tasks and project boards we are implementing. 

On the Friday morning call there is not enough time to implement all of the items we will be discussing, so we will use this time primarily for planning, and as we prioritize and identify project tasks we want to work on throughout the week, I will schedule live sessions where myself or other community members will be working on resolving project tasks, whether they are for support, bug resolution, content improvement, or platform feature requests. 

The most urgent task we identified on this past Friday’s call is the need to finalize our standards and processes for project management and tracking. This week I want to nail down an initial set of formal processes for entering issues, initial triage, routing to appropriate Kanban board, exactly which columns are present on each project board, and what milestones need to be completed to move through each stage from initial ticket entry through task completion. 

I will be hosting a live zoom session Tuesday 5/11/21 from 1-2:30pm, where I will be working on designing and implementing these process and project management standards for the community. Anyone who is available and interested is welcome to join either to observe or to actively engage in discussion and setup of these assets. A video replay of the meeting will be posted to the community youtube channel. If you are not able to join but would like to participate or contribute to this effort, please contact me directly – all volunteers are welcome!

This will be a live working session to support the goal of having a fully functional initial set of project management guidelines prior to Friday 5/14, as I want to review these policies and engage in active project planning on the ModernApps SRE Live! Weekly call on Friday. Accordingly, I may schedule additional times as needed throughout the week until we complete the task. 

Thank you!
